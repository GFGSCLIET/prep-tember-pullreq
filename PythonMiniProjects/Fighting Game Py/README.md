# Simple Text-Based Fighting Game with Tkinter GUI

## Description

The **Simple Text-Based Fighting Game** is a Python program that allows players to engage in turn-based combat with an AI opponent. The game is presented through a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library. Players can select one of three character classes and choose from different attack options to battle the opponent. The game provides an interactive and straightforward experience for players looking for casual entertainment.

## Key Features

1. **Character Selection:** Players can choose from three character classes: Boxer, Muay Thai, and Street Fighter. Each character class has its own set of statistics and attack modifiers.

2. **Fullscreen Mode:** The game offers a "Settings" section that allows players to toggle fullscreen mode on or off, providing flexibility in how they play the game.

3. **Health Tracking:** The GUI displays the health points of both the player and the opponent, allowing players to monitor their progress during the match.

4. **Turn-Based Combat:** Players can select from three different attacks: Punch, Kick, and Grapple. Each attack option inflicts different levels of damage on the opponent. The opponent also has the opportunity to counterattack based on random chance.

5. **Game Outcome:** The game continues until one of the combatants (player or opponent) has no health remaining. The program then displays the result of the match, such as "Player has won" or "Enemy has won."

6. **Game Restart:** Players have the option to restart the game, offering the opportunity for multiple rounds of combat.

7. **User-Friendly Interface:** The Tkinter-based GUI provides a user-friendly and visually appealing interface that makes it easy for players to understand and enjoy the game.

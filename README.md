# Trivago.com-Clone
I have cloned a e-commarce application called Trivago.com It simply meant allowing to Book a Hotel. Over time it has evolved to provide multiple benefits on one platform for all.

In this Project, I have tried to implement some of the functionalities of the application like search and along with these we have tried sorting functionalities and the User flow of booking a hotel and applying best available offers.

This is a Construct Week Project.

Questions 3: The function patternPrint(int n) is supposed to print n number of lines in the following pattern:
for n=4 pattern should be
1
1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1 1

The function compiles successfully but fails to return the desired results due to logical errors. Your task is to debug the program to pass all the test cases.


Given Code:
void patternPrint(int n)
{
 int print=1,i,j;
 for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
 {
  for(j=1;j<=i;j++)
  {
  printf("%d",print);
  printf("\n");
  }
 }
}
